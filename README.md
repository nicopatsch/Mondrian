# Mondrian generator

## What is this?

Mondrian Generator is a simple image generator that allows you to generate Mondrian-style paintings.

> ðŸ¤” Who the hell is Mondrian? ðŸ¤”

[Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian), or simply Piet Mondrian, was a Dutch 20th century painter who had this thing about primary colors and straight, horizontal and vertical lines. He was a pretty weird dude and his philosophy or art is rather intriguing. 

## How do I use it?

Just visit the web page following [this link](http://nicopatsch.github.io/Mondrian). Once on the page, you can twick the different buttons to personalize your drawing. Drawings are randomly generated but follow certain rules and parameters you can customize:

- The width of the lines
- The proportion of each color
- The number of divisionsâ€”that is, the number of times the program will redivide the rectangles into 2 new rectangles

Hope you enjoy it!

## TODO
This is what I'm planning to do next:
- Enable download as PNG in one clic of a button
- Polish the styling of the page
- Enhance code so that it doesn't make to small rectangles
- Enhance code so that it can make several end-to-end cuts in one (and get [this kind of stuff](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00648_9.jpg))
